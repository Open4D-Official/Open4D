Justify why this language is needed over C/C++, and how it will be used. Explanations can vary from a need to implement a specific feature, to simply not knowing how to program with C/C++. 

- **You may not use languages other than C/C++ for the core engine.**

- **You may use any languages without asking if you intend on creating a binding. A binding should not be places in /src/**

- **You may not use languages not designed for speed for tasks that require efficiency, such as geometry and physics. Languages like R and Python are examples of inefficient, uncompiled languages.
